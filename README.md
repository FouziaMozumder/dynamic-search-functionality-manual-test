Manual Testing â€“ Search Feature
This repository documents the complete manual testing workflow performed for the Search Feature of a software application. The goal of this testing effort was to ensure that the search functionality meets the defined requirements and works reliably across different scenarios. This includes requirement analysis, test case preparation, execution, reporting, and API/UI validations.

Requirement Analysis
The first phase involved thoroughly reviewing the functional and non-functional requirements of the search feature. This analysis helped identify key use cases, edge conditions, and integration points, laying the foundation for writing meaningful and comprehensive test cases.

Test Case Design
Based on the analysis, a wide range of test cases were written to cover:
Positive and negative scenarios
Input validations
UI behavior and usability
Functional flow of search queries
Edge cases like empty input, special characters, long strings, etc.
Each test case is documented with a clear objective, preconditions, test steps, expected results, and status.

Test Execution
Test cases were executed manually across multiple environments or builds. Results were documented in the execution log with pass/fail status, notes, and any defects found. Screenshots and logs are attached where applicable to provide clear evidence of behavior.

Test Summary Report
A detailed test summary report is included, outlining:
Total test cases written and executed
Pass/fail statistics
Defects found and their status
Observations and recommendations

API Testing with Postman
Postman was used to perform functional API testing for search-related endpoints. A complete Postman collection (.json) is included in the repo for reproducibility. API responses were validated against expected outputs, HTTP status codes, and data integrity.

UI Testing
Manual UI testing was conducted to ensure proper rendering, responsiveness, and search result handling on the interface.

This repository is a reference for QA professionals, developers, and stakeholders interested in understanding the quality assurance process behind the search feature.
